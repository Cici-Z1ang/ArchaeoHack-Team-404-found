# ArchaeoHack – Team 404 Found  
This is our project for the ArchaeoHack competition.  
We built a simple system that can recognize 30 Egyptian hieroglyphs.
We used a Conda environment called glyph for this project. 

The main libraries inside the environment are:
- Python 3.10
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- ......

If you want to run the project in the same way, you can create a similar environment

#How to Run the App
1. Install required Python packages
2. Unzip the data
3. Run the Streamlit app：streamlit run app.py
4. The app will open in your browser.

#If the app does not run on your machine because of environment or data issues, please do not worry. We can show the full demo during the presentation.
The main functions work on our computers, and we can draw signs and get predictions.
So if it is hard to set up everything on GitHub, we will demonstrate it live.
